Developed on Unity -V 2021.3.22f1

Installation Steps:

1. Download Sideload or Meta Developer Hub
2. Enable developer mode on Meta Quest Headset
3. Plug in the headset to computer
4. Load your prefered APK file into the headset

NOTES:

*   There are two APK files, the FNP file stands for "Fixed Node Placement" and statically assigns
    the nodes for Dijkstra's. The starting node is set to the Entrance to Jewett Hall, and the ending
    node is set to the entrance of Cleveland Commons

*   Adding to the project will require working with the version of Unity I was, going up a version might 
    break some of the XR_Rig stuff, so beware!

*   Feel free to reach out if you have issues setting the software up, or getting a development 
    version running!

Thanks For Visiting!
